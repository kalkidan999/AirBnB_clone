# Concepts
** The Console **
### The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine. it's first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI that will be built later
* create your data model
* manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
* store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
